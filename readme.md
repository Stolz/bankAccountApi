# Bank account API

Sample [Lumen](https://lumen.laravel.com/) application running on Docker services.

Docker containers are based on [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/about/) images which makes them smaller, more secure and more resource efficient.

The application implements an API to simulate the functionality of a basic bank account.
